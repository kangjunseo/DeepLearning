This directory is following `Pytorch Tutorial`. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html)   
I will change some of stuff to read tutorial more easily.   
I will delete all the unimportant parts, which makes to quickly review the tutorials when I want.   
The actual result of each md is runned by `Google colab`.
